Lifting + Resnets
=================

This repo contains some notebooks I have used to present some ideas on ResNets
and what else can be done with them.

The ResNet_Lifting.ipynb notebook was presented in July 2017 to the Signal
Processing Group.

The ResNet_Presentation.ipynb notebook was presented in November 2017 to the
Maths Department Deep Learning Reading Group.
